# Naverous Vendor System (Legacy Project)

**Status:** Legacy project. Work in progress as I upload and clean older components.

This was a full-featured vendor system I originally developed for Second Life using LSL for the front-end and PHP for the backend. Despite being written before formal training, it served a wide range of users and remained operational for several years.

### Highlights:
- Custom internal protocol and ID dictionary
- Designed for scalability and future extensibility
- Modular code structure
- Front-end written in Linden Scripting Language (LSL)
- Backend components (PHP) will be uploaded shortly after UUID cleanup

**Why I'm sharing it now:**  
While no longer monetized, I’m releasing this code to help others learn from both its strengths and its legacy quirks. It’s a real-world example of an organically grown system that evolved to meet practical needs.
